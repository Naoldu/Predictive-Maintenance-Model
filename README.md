# Predictive Maintenance Model
This project involves building a machine learning model for predicting maintenance needs in manufacturing systems.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the model: `predictive maintenance_model.py`

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting machine failures.
